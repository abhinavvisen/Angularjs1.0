# Angularjs1.0

A Simple Directory Application using angularjs1.0.After loading angular.min.js we create an Angular JS module called todoApp and a controller called todoController. Inside the controller we set up an empty array called tasks that will hold the todo list. We make it an attribute of the current $scope in order to make it accessible form the HTML.
